# PriNCe - **Pr**opagation **i**ncluding **N**uclear **C**ascade **e**quations

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/prince/badge/?version=latest)](https://prince.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

This code is written to solve the transport equation for ultra-high energy cosmic rays on cosmological scales.  

## Development status

Although the code is numerically accurate for its main purpose (UHECR propagation), one should consider it
as *early alpha*, simply because so far only us (the devs) have been using it and the interfaces aren't
sufficiently polished to be used *error-free* for tasks that we didn't foresee. Please file issues for
anything strange, unclear, wrong, etc.. It will help us to debug the code and simplify the user interface.

## Data and other requirements

The code requires data files which are **not** contained in the repository. You need to manually download the tarball from the [latest release](https://github.com/joheinze/PriNCe/releases) and unpack it to `./data`.

We are planning to make this download automatic in a future release.

## [Documentation](https://prince.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Uses `sphinx`-docs, which can be read at [readthedocs](https://prince.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

The documentation is still *incomplete*. Feedback/comments are welcome via issues.

## System requirements

- lots of RAM
- several GB disk space

## Software requirements

The majority of the code consists of pure Python modules.

Dependencies (list might be incomplete):

- python-3.7 or later
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- tqdm
- jupyter (optional, but needed for examples)

## Installation

Since this code is written in pure Python 3, it requries no installation. All you need is a python distribution including `pip`. For scientific computing [Anaconda/Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual/) is a good choice.

Simply `git clone` (or manually download) this repository and link it using `pip`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joheinze/PriNCe
cd PriNCe
pip install -e .
```

To test an installation:
```bash
pip install pytest
python -m pytest --pyargs prince_cr
```

This will automatically install the dependencies. If you do not want to use `pip` you can also just add this folder to your `PYTHONPATH`.
